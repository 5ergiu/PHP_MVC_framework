// needs work here 

this can be changed directly from config/constants so 

you just have to redefine that instead of going and changing everything in every place.
 
 NOTE: TEMPLATES were made in such a way that each one would be in it's one folder, in 
 case that's needed to be changed, some more advanced changes woudl be required,
 not just changing the TEMPLATES constant.
